# Docker Consolidation Summary

## Overview
Successfully consolidated 10 separate Docker Compose files into a single, unified `docker-compose.yml` file for building and testing Scryer Prolog's WASI components.

## Previous State
The project had the following Docker Compose files:
- `docker-compose.yml` (original)
- `docker-compose.cli.yml`
- `docker-compose.cli-lowmem.yml`
- `docker-compose.cli-minimal.yml`
- `docker-compose.cli-optimized.yml`
- `docker-compose.cli-test.yml`
- `docker-compose.wasi.yml`
- `docker-compose.wasi-simple.yml`
- `docker-compose.wasi-test.yml`
- `docker-compose.wit-check.yml`

## Current State
- Single consolidated `docker-compose.yml` with all functionality
- Clear service organization and naming
- Optimized for 20GB available memory (no artificial limits)
- Full parallelization support

## Consolidated Services

### Build Services
- `build` - Main build service for both library and CLI components
- `build-dev` - Development build with debug info
- `build-library` - Library component only
- `build-cli` - CLI component only
- `build-wasip1` - Legacy wasm32-wasip1 build

### Test Services
- `test` - Comprehensive test suite
- `validate-wit` - WIT file validation
- `benchmark` - Performance benchmarks

### Interactive Services
- `repl` - Interactive WASI REPL
- `dev` - Development shell with all tools

### Utility Services
- `clean` - Clean build artifacts

## Key Improvements

### 1. Simplified Build Process
- Single command to build both components: `docker compose run --rm build`
- Automatic installation of all required tools (clang, cargo-component, wasm-tools, wit-deps)
- Proper error handling and validation

### 2. Fixed Build Issues
- Corrected clang installation (removed `--no-install-recommends` flag)
- Proper environment variable setup for WASM compilation
- Architecture detection for tool downloads

### 3. Better Organization
- Logical grouping of services
- Consistent naming conventions
- Clear dependencies between services

### 4. Enhanced Documentation
- Created `DOCKER_WASI_BUILD.md` with comprehensive usage guide
- Created `test-docker-build.sh` for automated testing
- Added inline documentation in docker-compose.yml

## Usage Examples

### Quick Build and Test
```bash
# Build everything
docker compose run --rm build

# Run tests
docker compose run --rm test

# Start REPL
docker compose run --rm repl
```

### Development Workflow
```bash
# Enter development shell
docker compose run --rm dev

# Validate WIT files
docker compose run --rm validate-wit

# Clean and rebuild
docker compose run --rm clean
docker compose run --rm build
```

## Technical Details

### Memory and Performance
- No artificial memory limits (uses full 20GB available)
- Parallel builds enabled by default
- Optimized cargo and build caching using Docker volumes

### Docker Volumes
- `cargo-cache` - Cargo registry cache
- `cargo-git` - Cargo git dependencies  
- `target-cache` - Build artifacts cache

### Environment Variables
- Proper WASM toolchain configuration
- Clang setup for cross-compilation
- Optimization flags for release builds

## Migration Notes

### For Users of Old Compose Files
Replace old commands with new equivalents:
- `docker-compose -f docker-compose.cli.yml ...` → `docker compose run --rm build`
- `docker-compose -f docker-compose.wasi.yml ...` → `docker compose run --rm build-wasip1`
- `docker-compose -f docker-compose.wit-check.yml ...` → `docker compose run --rm validate-wit`

### Removed Files
All the following files have been safely removed:
- `docker-compose.cli*.yml`
- `docker-compose.wasi*.yml`
- `docker-compose.wit-check.yml`

## Future Considerations

### Potential Improvements
1. Add GitHub Actions integration examples
2. Create multi-stage builds for smaller final images
3. Add support for custom build profiles
4. Consider adding test coverage reporting

### Maintenance
- Keep tool versions updated (cargo-component, wasm-tools, wit-deps)
- Monitor for changes in WASI toolchain requirements
- Update wasmtime runtime versions as needed

## Conclusion
The consolidation significantly simplifies the Docker-based build process while maintaining all functionality. The new structure is more maintainable, better documented, and easier to use for both development and CI/CD purposes.
